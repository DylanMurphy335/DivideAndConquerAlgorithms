# DivideAndConquerAlgorithms
A project in which I was given all the files uploaded but the "DivideAndConquerAlgorithms.java" file had no methods written, so the methods belong to me and the rest to my lecturer.

Part 1 of 3.

Included in DivideAndConquerAlgorithms.java:
iterativeDisplayElements(),
maxInt(),
isReverse(),
getNumAppearances(),
power(),
lucas(),
drawImage().
*read the file for further information on these methods*
